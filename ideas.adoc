Interactiveness:
https://matklad.github.io/2019/11/16/a-better-shell[matklad:  A Better Shell]
Plan9's ACME editor
  * Plumbing and Mouse Chords
  * Really simple API for plugin integration
Emacs Lisp Interaction Mode
PowerShell and NuShell for tabled/structured output rather than text
Fish shell
  * automatically read man for autocompletion
Zsh
  * good navigation for autocomplete menu

Compiler Design:
* JAI
  * programmic access to typing (post-lexer) but before message-send allows lots of static analysis
  * job system for compiling
  * run loop before compile loop
  * static analysis tools are written in JAI itself

* Zig
  * explicit comptime (compile time) keyword for generating code at compile time
